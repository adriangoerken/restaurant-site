## Backend Integration Points (TODO)

The following features are ready for backend integration:

1. **Event Reservation System**

    - Button click handlers in EventCard component
    - Should integrate with reservation API
    - Requires availability checking

2. **Newsletter Subscription**

    - Form submission in NewsletterSection
    - Email validation implemented
    - Ready for API endpoint connection

3. **Private Event Inquiries**

    - CTA buttons in CTASection
    - Should navigate to contact/inquiry form
    - Integration with contact API needed

4. **Dynamic Event Data**
    - Replace mock data in `eventsData.tsx`
    - Connect to events API
    - Implement real-time availability updates

## Mock Data Notes

-   All event dates are set in future (Nov-Dec 2025)
-   Prices are realistic for a modern fusion restaurant
-   Mix of availability statuses to demonstrate UI states
-   Events include varied types (dinners, workshops, celebrations)
-   Promotions include both time-limited and ongoing offers

## Component Reusability

-   `EventCard` component can be reused for:
    -   Past events display
    -   Search results
    -   Filtered event lists
-   `PromotionCard` component can be reused for:
    -   Homepage special offers section
    -   Seasonal promotion highlights
    -   Member-exclusive deals

## Performance Considerations

-   Lazy loading compatible structure
-   Optimized re-renders with React.memo potential
-   Efficient animation with Framer Motion
-   Minimal bundle impact

## Testing Recommendations

When backend is implemented, test:

1. Event reservation flow for all availability states
2. Newsletter subscription with various email formats
3. Form validation edge cases
4. Translation switching
5. Responsive behavior on all devices
6. Keyboard navigation
7. Screen reader compatibility
8. Loading states for async operations
9. Error handling for failed API calls

## Next Steps

1. Connect to backend APIs when available
2. Implement actual navigation for CTA buttons
3. Add image uploads for events
4. Implement past events gallery (optional)
5. Add filtering/search for events
6. Implement calendar view (optional enhancement)
7. Add event sharing functionality
8. Implement reminder/notification system
